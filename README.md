# Agon CPU Emulator

**Note that this repo is no longer an external dependency of 
[Fab Agon Emulator](https://github.com/tomm/fab-agon-emulator), and has
now been moved into that repo (as agon-ez80-emulator). This
repo is obsolete**.

===============================================

An emulator of the Agon Light CPU (eZ80F92) and CPU-controlled peripherals,
with host filesystem integration.

For a complete Agon Light emulator, including the VDP (ESP32) side of the system,
see [Fab Agon Emulator](https://github.com/tomm/fab-agon-emulator),
which uses this crate combined with a graphical (SDL) Agon VDP emulator.

This Agon CPU Emulator can be used stand-alone, as a text-only emulation
of Agon Light:

```
cargo run --release
```

This will pass stdin input to the Agon CPU as VDP keypress packets.
You can use this for a scripted Agon emulation:

```
$ echo "credits
cat" | cargo run -r
Tom's Fake VDP Version 1.03
Agon Quark MOS Version 1.03

This is how the regression suite is implemented. You can run the
regression suite with:

```
sh ./run_regression_test.sh
```
